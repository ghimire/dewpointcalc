dewpointcalc - gnokii based Weather Temperature Calculator written in PHP.

Installation
------------
Install gnokii with mysql backend. On Debian/Ubuntu, this is done by,
# apt-get install gnokii-common gnokii-smsd-mysql gnokii

Connect your phone to computer through USB cable. The 'dmesg' command
displays the device location. In many cases, it's /dev/ttyACM0

Modify /etc/gnokiirc to add the port information, model, baudrate, and
telephone number. Sample config is shown below.

    [global]
    port = /dev/ttyACM0
    model = AT
    initlength = default
    connection = serial
    use_locking = yes
    serial_baudrate = 19200
    smsc_timeout = 10
    [xgnokii]
    allow_breakage = 0
    [gnokiid]
    bindir = /usr/sbin/
    [connect_script]
    TELEPHONE = 1234567
    [disconnect_script]
    [logging]
    debug = off
    rlpdebug = off

Test if it's working,
$ echo "This is a test message." | gnokii --sendsms 987654321

1) Create mysql database 
   Example: 
   > create database 'temperature';
   > grant all privileges on `temperature`.* to `smsgw-user`@`localhost` identified
     by 's3cr37passw0rd';
2) Import temperature.sql file
   $ mysql -p -u smsgw-user temperature < temperature.sql
   
   You may delete temperature.sql after importing it.
   
2) Modify include/config.php to match the db details above
   Example:
   define("HOST","localhost");
   define("DB_NAME","temperature");
   define("DB_USER","sms-user");
   define("DB_PW","s3cr37passw0rd");

Running the application
-----------------------
Start by adding return_temperature_data.php  cron job to run every minute,
shown as below:
    * * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/return_temperature_data.php 

Assuming, the details above, start gnokii daemon by typing following on the
terminal:
$ /usr/sbin/smsd -u sms-user -d temperature -c localhost -m mysql -b IN -f /var/log/temperature.log

The daemon will monitor the temperature database for any incoming text message on the
phone first line of which is wet bulb temperature, dry bulb temperature and atmospheric
pressure. Once the calculation is done, the dew point, relative humidity and vapor pressure are
returned to the sender.
